Munugode bypoll: K Chandrasekhar Rao wields poach gate to bomb BJP in last lap
HYDERABAD: A recent trip to the salon almost turned fatal for a 50-year-old woman from Hyderabad, who suffered a stroke while getting her hair washed before a haircut. Doctors treating her said that a key vessel supplying blood to the brain was pressed when she bent back her neck for the wash, causing the stroke.
Incidentally, such health scares - often termed as the "beauty parlour stroke syndrome" after it was first reported in the US in 1993 - have been reported in the past too, said city doctors, adding that similar cases are common among men walking into salons for a neck massage.
